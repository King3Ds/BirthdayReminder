## How the Extension works
1. Input your friend's/family member's name, their birthday, a reminder time, and you will receive a reminder for their birthday :)
2. You will receive a confirmation like below:

4. Later, on the reminder time, you will receive a message on the right corner of your screen

## Why did I make this?
I use my laptop more than my mobile devices, and I wanted a way to keep track of my friend's b-days
